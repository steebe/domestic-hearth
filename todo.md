- change the dynamic icon loading such that: default state is ash, upon actually redirecting, enable icon

- make override table fixed height, and scrollable once rows exceed height

- allow for deleting row items, rather than relying on a full clear to delete overrides

- create user settings
  - enable "are you sure" modal
  - enable "me time": hours users can configure as time periods in which overrides are disabled
